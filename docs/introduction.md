# Introduction

Set up your **wwwpy** development environment with these steps:

1. **Create a Python virtual environment:** Open a terminal in your project directory and run: <br>`pip install wwwpy`.
2. **Create an empty folder** and open it in your preferred IDE.<br>`mkdir my_project`<br>`cd my_project`
3. **Open a shell** within your IDE (this allows the console output to link directly to file sources) and start **`wwwpy dev`**. This command opens a browser window displaying your developing web app.
4. **Arrange your IDE and browser side by side** so you can view your app's code in the IDE and the app interface in the browser simultaneously.

**Note:** In the IDE shell, **wwwpy** logs clickable file paths and line numbers, enabling direct navigation to relevant code. When creating event handlers or encountering exceptions, click the log entries to jump to the specified lines.

## A wwwpy Project Structure

In a typical **wwwpy** project structure, you'll encounter these three main folders:

- **common:** The **common** folder holds environment-neutral Python code and resources that run on both server and browser. Avoid server- or browser-specific APIs here to maintain compatibility.

- **remote:** This folder houses **browser-specific Python code** and resources. At startup, **wwwpy** transfers the contents of both the “common” and “remote” folders to the browser, allowing the code to execute on the client side.

- **server:** This folder is dedicated to **server-side Python code and resources**. The content here stays on the server and is never transferred to the browser.

This structure creates a clear separation of responsibilities, ensuring you can easily distinguish code that should run in the browser from code meant only for the server, while maintaining a flexible shared layer in the **common** folder.

## Quickstart in Dev Mode

When running **`wwwpy dev`** in an *empty* directory, the browser will display a **quickstart selector**. This selector allows you to choose from various starter templates to kick off your project, giving you a functional foundation to build upon.

Each template is pre-configured to demonstrate core features, offering a practical way to explore how things are structured and implemented in **wwwpy**. Selecting a template not only helps you get started quickly but also allows you to examine the source code directly in your IDE to understand how specific components and functionality are set up. This makes it easy to dive deeper, modify, and extend the initial setup as needed, all while learning from established patterns and best practices.


> **Note:** The folder must be truly *empty* for the **quickstart selector** to appear. Some IDEs automatically add starter files when opening a blank project, which can interfere with this feature. If you don’t see the quickstart selector, check your folder and remove any auto-generated files before running **`wwwpy dev`** again.

## Navigating Code with Console Logs

### Streamlined Debugging with Interactive Logs

**wwwpy**'s interactive logs simplify debugging by enabling quick navigation within your IDE:

- **Clickable Logs:** Click log entries in the IDE shell to jump directly to the relevant code line.
- **Event Handler Tracking:** Instantly locate new event handlers by clicking the logged file and line number.
- **Error Navigation:** Jump to errors directly by clicking on the log entry, expediting troubleshooting.

### Forwarded Browser Logs

When running in development mode, **wwwpy** also forwards browser logs generated by the standard Python logging module, including any browser exceptions, to the server console. This feature enhances usability by centralizing all logs and errors in one location, allowing you to:

- **Monitor Browser Logs and Exceptions in Real-Time:** Instead of switching back and forth between the browser’s developer console and your IDE, you can view browser log messages and exceptions directly in your IDE shell.
- **Simplify Debugging and Development:** With both server and client logs, as well as any errors, centralized in one place, you can more easily track issues, test functionality, and make adjustments without unnecessary navigation.

Centralized logging across both client and server improves workflow efficiency, allowing you to focus on development without switching between tools.
